Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

In my csv to json conversion project, I built a gui that had an input and output text 
field. I wanted to make both of these scrollable, and apply other settings. Doing it
twice would've added quite a bit of copy paste to my code, and I wanted to condence it down.
I found out I could pass in tkinter objects into a parameter, and I was able to reuse part 
of my code by containing it in a function.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions and pytest can simplify the testing process. Sometimes print statements 
and the debugger are the best way to test, but some process functions are used in many 
situations and require many input/output comparisons. These provide the best value to 
function testing. Testing by function allows for these comparisons, and can make it 
really easy to target a specific part of the program.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

Over the course of my project, I've moved many of my functions to sparate files 
to make it easy to test and edit parts of the program. The debugger has come in handy
a couple times. One thing I can do to improve my testing process is looking from the
perspective of the user, and try to see what kinds of unexected input can pop up.
